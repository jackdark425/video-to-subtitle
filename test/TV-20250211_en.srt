1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
The last strike in the Bundestag before the election in just two weeks.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,600
The only topic of the general debate is the situation in Germany.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,000
Broadly enough so that the parties can really get it out again.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,600
The start was still warmly run by the TV duel of Chancellor of the Union,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
candidate Merz and Chancellor Scholz.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If we now, despite the low number of asylum seekers, call on the security and order of Germany to be out of control

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and therefore we should not have to apply European law,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then other countries will use this argument quite the same,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
apart from the fact that it does not exist in court.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That would not be just the end of the European asylum reform,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
which Germany is the biggest profit for,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
even before it takes effect next year.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That would not just be the end of the European border,

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union as a legal community.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Have you ever heard the word German vote?

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That was the shipwreck in Brussels for the constant detentions of the federal government,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the Federal Republic of Germany, the ministers and the European Council,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
because they were so divided in their coalition that they usually did not know

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
how to vote in Brussels.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A German government has never found so much criticism and so much contempt in Brussels

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
as this current government.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
For this reason, it will be time for them to stop.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And Christoph MeÃŸmacher is following the debate in Berlin for us.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Christoph, how do you perceive the atmosphere at this last speech before the Bundestag election?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I would like to describe it best with a small miniature.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
During the speech by Alice Weidel, she complained about the aroused and very loud intercom calls,

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
especially from the ranks of the Greens.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And Babel-Bas took it with a dry counter to the knowledge and addressed Alice Weidel.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She could deal with her own faction, as far as the volume of the intercom calls is concerned.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It was an intense speech.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It was not what the speeches were about, which was very toxic.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The intercom calls were a bit out of the frame.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There was more whistling in the German Bundestag, which is now very rare.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But overall, the classic positions that were expected have been exchanged again.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
For me, interesting were the one or the other side aspects.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We have just heard small excerpts from Scholz and Merz.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What are the two points of focus?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The points of focus that everyone who is interested in politics has noticed in the last days and weeks.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But that is not criticism, but it would be admissible to believe that new positions will be presented today.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
As I said, there were some small side notes in the speakers in the role ratio, according to my observation.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What was noticed in the speech of Friedrich Merz was that he was the only one in my perception who addressed the day after the election.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then there was Glintner and Weidel. What was particularly remarkable for you?

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Robert Habeck tried to change the situation a bit, if I may say so.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There is a lot to be said. There is a lot of party criticism, or at least acceptable criticism, on his ten-point plan on migration and asylum.

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Today, a letter from the Green Federal Labor Union on peace and migration is expected to be published.

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Green Party is not quite satisfied with what your chancellor candidate has said there.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Robert Habeck used his speech to make it clear that it also has to do with integration on the topic of migration.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There have been a lot of omissions and that this has to change now is the view of the party.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He also tried to address the future topics, including education and climate protection.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Christian Lindner tried it with humor. He saw Olaf Scholz as the next Nobel Prize winner in the ranks of the SPD after Willy Brandt.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He also tried to make it clear that he lost contact with the economy, especially the medium-sized companies.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's why he was probably the next Nobel Prize winner because he proved that there are parallel universes.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Christoph, many citizens are annoyed by the political disputes that the political parties are having.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What could the parties do to get more sympathy?

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
To be honest, Chancellor Scholz made a point in his speech.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He said that the debate situation is very exciting, but that on the other hand,

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
a lot of different positions are clearly defined than in times of the big coalition.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That is certainly a point that many people have to get used to.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The debate has gained a lot of focus.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
In my translation, there are very different election programs, very different models of how Germany should be shaped,

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
or in other words, in which Germany you actually want to live.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And that is actually something advantageous for a democratic debate,

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
because you can clearly see differences in all political areas.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That is definitely my conviction.

65
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
To regain confidence, that means collateral damage, you are certainly right.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The sharpness of the debate and above all the great noise concert of the traffic light until it was over,

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
has certainly cost confidence.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Friedrich Merz spoke today on February 24, which is the day after the election,

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and he has very strongly applied for an alliance from the middle of the democratic parties,

70
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
because otherwise he is worried about the country's cohesion in the next four years.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Keyword alliance, so after the election, coalition talks are held.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
After these unspoken tones, is there any constructive cooperation at all,

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
or is there a lot of broken porcelain?

74
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It is broken porcelain, but I am inclined to a pragmatism.

75
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I believe that on March 24 it will be a bit tricky,

76
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
then I have to see which personnel then still exists and who then even possible coalition negotiations lead.

77
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But I am very pragmatically strict and believe, as I said,

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that the parties will not give the blamage again to receive an invitation from the federal president,

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to please agree on an alliance.

80
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In this respect, on March 24, some will lick their wounds, others will celebrate themselves as winners.

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And then a coalition must be found and the prices are raised.

82
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And then at the end there will be a government.

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This will be a tedious, also noisy, process, but I am unwavering at this point.

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There will be an alliance, it will be governed.

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you, Christoph, for this assessment.

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
My pleasure.
